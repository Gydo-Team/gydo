### Gydo 0.1.2
Our package "gydo-js" has had it's first major update and many of our thanks go to Apple Inc.#3259 for getting it done.

The package is now in version: 0.1.2 | We went straight from 0.0.3 as there was need to continue on that part.

You can now use the package to actually start up your bot with a token. We just need to setup a little thing that will show you how and what to do to get it working.
